  title: 5 Series (E12, E28, E34, E39, E60, E61)
  description: From the very beginning the 5 Series has had cutting edge styling with
    leading edge performance. Comfortable on a plush drive, or capable in a performance
    setting, the 5 Series has always done it all. From the Sedan, to the Touring,
    to the Beast known as the ///M5, there is a reason that 5 Series owners are the
    most steadfast enthusiasts of the brand.

  title: 1996 - 2003 (E39)
  description: The BMW 5 Series (E39) is the generation of BMW 5 Series made between
    1995 and 2003. The E39 series was the successor of the BMW 5 Series (E34) in 1995,
    and was replaced by the E60 in 2003. Sales to Germany and most of Western Europe
    began in 1995, and by 1996 sales to the rest of the world had commenced. A mid-generational
    refresh appeared in 2000, featuring minute detail changes. At launch, the base
    model was the 520i, which developed 112 kilowatts (150 hp) in the pre-update models,
    and 126 kilowatts (170 hp) in later models. An M5 variant was introduced in 1998,
    with a 4.9-litre S62 V8 engine. All models but the M5 were available as either
    a saloon or an estate, the latter called Touring.
