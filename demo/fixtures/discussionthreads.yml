  body: I purchased these Euro Headlights not knowing what i was getting into... apparently
    they have an adjustment motor i wasn't aware of. I have all the switches and plugs,
    but for the life of me i cant figure out how to wire it. I have an american model
    1992 e34 so i'm thinking it wouldn't have the wires already. Can anybody shed
    some light on this?

  title: Did you guys see this car on Ebay?!..very nice Euro M5 low miles..
  body: 17x8.5et13 with 235/45 tires fit no problem. A 17x8et10 would be inside the
    envelope of an 8.5et13, it will work no problem. I could easy go with a 245/40
    tire if I deemed the extra width necessary. I did run 20mm spacers in the rear
    which did require some fender massaging.

  title: Mirrors not adjusting - new seats to blame?
  body: I just changed over to a Sport Seat on the drivers side (testing it before
    i have both sides redone) and noticed that my mirrors no longer adjusted. I checked
    the fuses and they are all good. is there something I am missing in the connections
    under the seat that needs to be pinned or fixed? The std seat I had had memory
    as does the new sport seat. All other options are there with the exception of
    lumbar support which the sport seat does not have. Any help is appreciated.

  title: 'FS: Redfive''s Turbo M30 - entire setup (radiator to driveshaft)'
  body: "After 10 years with this engine, I’m ready to move on to something else.
    Normally, people would just sell the car, but I don't feel I'll get nearly enough
    for it. Plus what I want to do next allows me to reuse the rest of my car. (if
    you want the whole car, I'll sell it for $25k - Turbo engine, D-force wheels,
    new interior, BBK, GC coil overs and all the other goodies but not the ACS widebody
    setup or Speedline Wheels)\r\nThe engine is currently in the car and is available
    for test drive. Removal will take approximately 1-2 weeks and will require some
    notice. My total cost of this build is over $35,000 and nearly all of the issues
    have been resolved. The setup could use some more tuning to eliminate some minor
    holes in the map and to improve driveability (as a DD) or if you want more power.
    It currently has over 30 hours of tuning (I let the tuner use the car as a daily
    for several weeks).\r\nEngine was producing 280 rwhp and 350 rwtq at just 8 psi
    when tuned. The setup now runs 15psi. Figure on approximately 400rwhp in current
    tune. The setup is well sorted and is 98% there. I do not have a dyno chart for
    this configuration.\r\n\r\nI’m selling it because it doesn’t suit how the car
    is driven now. For the longest time my car was a track car used occasionally on
    the street. It was used in my 2011 One Lap of America adventure and it wasn’t
    fully sorted at the time. The issues that occurred during the race have been resolved
    and are no longer an issue. My life situation has changed (2 kids, 2 dogs, a wife
    and a good sized house) and a track car doesn’t get driven much. (Crazy to think
    that when I started this I had a girlfriend, a dog, and a small house) I've converted
    my car to street spec, so it gets used more. I also have a desire to go back to
    a naturally aspirated engine."
